      {`# Les problÃ¨mes

- **Staying on REST is hard** > after few months of one project, you may have a lot of customs routes and endpoints.
- GraphQL solve this problem with one **single endpoint** and a limitless of possibilities with its **type system**.
- One newcomer may find all this Resolvers system a bit tricky at the beginning.
- For example, it is easy to protect some endpoints in REST, but how to do this in GraphQL ?

**SHORT BREAK** 

- One other thing is that it is complicated to test your API when you are using an ORM.
- Unit testing an ORM is something necessary though
(read the article by strong loop titled "hack, don't test. hacker, don't mock")
- One other thing, if you want to change Data with an ORM, you likely need to change the view too.

**SHORT BREAK**

- Finally, a good ORM optimize your calls 90% of the time.
- The other 10%, you face huge difficulties and you end up making raw queries.
